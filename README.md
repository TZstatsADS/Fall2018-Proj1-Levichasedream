This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
+ This project is conducted by [Xin Jin-Uni:xj2215]

+ Project summary: :People have numerous happiness moments during their lives. In this project, we applied the sentence analysis, topic modeling and sentiments analysis. First, we want to see whether old people tend to talk more when they refer to happiness moments. Second, we want to see whether the age will have the influence on their happiness moments. Third, we would like to see whether the gender would affect people's happiness moments.
